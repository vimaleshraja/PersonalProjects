This page gives a brief description of my projects and their Demo.

## [Project 1: Automatic Modulation Classification Using Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) ](https://github.com/vimaleshraja/Automated-Modulation-Classification)
- This was my Directed study (EE5805) where I explored the use ML in Signal Classification problem in Physical Layer of OSI model.
- Reproduced the existing Papers which used CNN, LSTM, Data Augmentation techniques.
- Built new architecture using TCN and compared the performanace with the existing models
- Used Tools: Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter Notebook, Python.

## [Project 2: Portfolio Website Analytics - Live Dashboard of this Website](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/gUyPPiDRr1I)
- This Dashboard helped me explore Looker Dashboarding Tool.
- Looker has been connected to the Google Analytics Platform to get the live updates of the data.
- This helps me track the number of users who engages in seeing my website.
- Used Tools: Looker, Google Analytics Platform, Google Cloud Platform.

## [Project 3: ASL Prediction using Vanilla CNN 5 Layered Architecture](https://github.com/vimaleshraja/flask_ASL)
- Used Flask to deploy the CNN model for predicting American Sign Language.
- Used Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, Flask.
- Used Tools: VScode, Git, Anaconda Environment.

## [Project 4: ASL Prediction Model Comparison](https://github.com/vimaleshraja/ASL_Model_Selection)
- This project different comparison of models and data preprocessing methodologies for efficient image classification task.
- A brief comparison of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- Group Project of 3 people. My contributions was in Preprocessing, and SVM model comparison.
- Used Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tensorflow
- Used Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda Environment, Linux, Latex

## [Project 5: Food Recognition Using CNN and EfficientNet](https://github.com/vimaleshraja/Food_Recognition)
- Used CNN 2-Layered, 5-Layered, 6-Layered with data augmentation, and EfficientnetV2 architecture.
- Brief comparison of model perfomance and accuracy has been done.
- Got validation accuracy of 81.5% using EfficientnetV2 .
- Group Project of 3 people. My contributions was in Preprocessing, and EfficientnetV2 model comparison.
- Used Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tensorflow
- Used Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda Environment, Latex.

## [Project 6: F1 Race Data Visualization](https://github.com/RajaVimalesh/UN5550)
- A complete analysis on F1 Race happened from 1950-2022.
- Various plots which include bar, line, area chart has been used to get insights of race.
- Used streamlit to create interactive dashboard for the insights.
- Group Project of 3 people. My contributions was in creating plots, dashboard, hosting it in the streamlit cloud.
- Used Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Streamlit, Matplotlib.
- Used Tools: VScode, Anaconda Environment, Git, Streamlit Cloud.


## [Project 7: Shuttle Bus Analysis](https://github.com/vimaleshraja/bus_arrival_analysis)
- Analysis on the bus arrival time and the drivers efficiency of MTU campus shuttle.
- Performed statistical methods like Two way Anova to check the efficiency of the driver.
- Further performed Tukey's test to find which Time and driver had the best and worst efficient.
- Used Tools: R, SAS


## [Project 8: Call Drop Prediction Using XGBoost Regressor](https://github.com/vimaleshraja/calldrop)
- Built a eXtreme Gradient Boosting Regression model for predicting the call drop on a Base Transeiver Station.
- Model had an 6% loss on the Root Mean Squared Error of the training and test set.
- Used Streamlit Library for getting insights on the dataset to find a trend or the seasonality of the dataset by visualization.
- Used Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- Used Tools: Python, VScode, Git, Streamlit Cloud.
