# This page gives a brief description of my projects and their Demo.

## [Project 1: ASL Prediction using Vanilla CNN 5 Layered Architecture](https://github.com/vimaleshraja/flask_ASL)
- Used Flask to deploy the CNN model for predicting American Sign Language.
- Used Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, Flask.
- Used Tools: VScode, Git, Anaconda Environment.

## [Project 2: ASL Prediction Model Comparison](https://github.com/vimaleshraja/ASL_Model_Selection)
- This project different comparison of models and data preprocessing methodologies for efficient image classification task.
- A brief comparison of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification
- Group Project of 3 people. My contributions was in Preprocessing, and SVM model comparison 
- Used Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tensorflow
- Used Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda Environment, Linux

## [Project 3: Food Recognition Using CNN and EfficientNet](https://github.com/vimaleshraja/Food_Recognition)
- Created Machine learning regression project using scikit-learn library of python.
- It takes such details of car and in return gives approximate price like all other car-selling business sites for example cars24.
- Used <i>Regression supervised learning</i>.
- Dataset taken from Kaggle : [Data](https://github.com/Smit271/Car-selling-price-prediction/blob/main/data/Car_details_v3.csv)
- Used <b>flask</b> framework to deploy it over web.
