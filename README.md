# [Project 3: Food Recognition Using CNN and EfficientNet](https://github.com/vimaleshraja/Food_Recognition)
- Created Machine learning regression project using scikit-learn library of python.
- It takes such details of car and in return gives approximate price like all other car-selling business sites for example cars24.
- Used <i>Regression supervised learning</i>.
- Dataset taken from Kaggle : [Data](https://github.com/Smit271/Car-selling-price-prediction/blob/main/data/Car_details_v3.csv)
- Used <b>flask</b> framework to deploy it over web.

# [Project 4: Multipurpose web-app : Project overview](https://github.com/Smit271/Multipurpose-web-app-using-flask)
- Created Multipurpose general web-application using different APIs listed below in python.
- Web-applicaiton home page shows you advice per refresh, time (Used Javascript for this).
- Then it will show you current weather of city you entered, Movie details of entered movie name, 5 synonyms of the word.
- You can register to daily 7 AM weather update for multiple cities with email id.
- Used Flask framework and deployed over [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) platform.

3. Team member can update project details.
4. Can assign task to particular user with proper description, deadline and user can update status as per task's status/progress.
5. Overall overview of Internal company's projects with its all usefull details.


# [Project 7: Online Attendance using face recognition : Project overview](https://github.com/Smit271/Online-Attendance-Using_Face-Recognition)
- University project created in team of 4 & my contribution was in backend, neural network model building.
- This project is to overcome our traditional attendance system (Pen-paper) of education.
- Used Google Facenet neural networks model for embeddings.
- Added some useful funcitonalities like monthly attendance downloader, student's daily attendance sheet.
- Students can also view if there attendance are taken or not.
- Created neural networks model using python, tensorflow framework.
- Used flask microservice framework for backend of web-application.
- Here you can see project report : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xl2n_8PQjkrgJPSp2YC_A8nq4QY1_1Mb/view?usp=sharing

# [Project 8: Nature's Image classifier : Project overview](https://github.com/Smit271/Image-classifier-using-cnn)
- Created Neural networks project using tensorflow framework in python.
- It takes image from user of forest, street, mountain, sea, glacier and gives classified name with certain accuracy.
- Used concepts of <i>Convolutional neural network and pooling layers</i> for computer vision problem. 
- Dataset taken from Kaggle : [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification)
- Used <b>flask</b> framework to deploy it over web.
- Deployed over heroku platform.

## Live web-application link:
- It will take 2-3 minutes to open as if i deployed it on free PAAS platform.

# [Project 9: Traffic sign recognition : Project overview](https://github.com/Smit271/Traffic-Sign-Recognition)
- My B.E. 7th sem project 
- Created Neural networks project using tensorflow framework in python.
- Dataset taken from Kaggle : [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign)
- Used <b>flask</b> framework to deploy it over web.
- Deployed over heroku platform.
- To build the model and train the model I have used python and CNN architecture. To build this website I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap framework.


## Why i took this project?
- As we all know from now on all things and mechanisms are becoming automatic and the best example of that is <b>Tesla's self driving car</b>. we all know Elon musk and heard about Tesla's self- Driving car. So one out of thousands factor which helps car to drive itself is traffic sign detection and recognition so basically i thought about let's make one part of it so here i made it. Obviously Self driving car has much better model's accurcay and all but here is one intution.

# [Project 10: Object detection using YOLO v-3 : Project overview](https://github.com/Smit271/YOLO-v3)
- Created Object detection using yolo v3 in python.
- Takes image as an input and gives output image of detection object and showing using rectangle of different colors.
- Useful in detection of some rare things because it is efficient.
