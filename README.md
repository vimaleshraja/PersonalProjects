# This page gives a brief description of my projects and their Demo.

## [Project 1: ASL Prediction using Vanilla CNN 5 Layered Architecture](https://github.com/vimaleshraja/flask_ASL)
- Used Flask to deploy the CNN model for predicting American Sign Language.
- Used Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, Flask.
- Used Tools: VScode, Git, Anaconda Environment.

## [Project 2: ASL Prediction Model Comparison](https://github.com/vimaleshraja/ASL_Model_Selection)
- This project different comparison of models and data preprocessing methodologies for efficient image classification task.
- A brief comparison of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- Group Project of 3 people. My contributions was in Preprocessing, and SVM model comparison.
- Used Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tensorflow
- Used Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda Environment, Linux, Latex

## [Project 3: Food Recognition Using CNN and EfficientNet](https://github.com/vimaleshraja/Food_Recognition)
- Used CNN 2-Layered, 5-Layered, 6-Layered with data augmentation, and EfficientnetV2 architecture.
- Brief comparison of model perfomance and accuracy has been done.
- Got validation accuracy of 81.5% using EfficientnetV2 .
- Group Project of 3 people. My contributions was in Preprocessing, and EfficientnetV2 model comparison.
- Used Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tensorflow
- Used Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda Environment, Latex
